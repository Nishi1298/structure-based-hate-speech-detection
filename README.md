# Structure Based-Hate Speech Detection

Contributors: Ravsimar Singh, Ishita Vohra, Aniket Shrimal, Harsh Shukla

## Problem Statement 
Traditional methods for hate speech detection use tons of training data to mine the hateful structure but due to disproportionate use of different terms they are prone towards learning bias against specific objects, personalities or groups. Idea is to propose a method that takes into account the grammatical structure of the sentence to predict hatefulness.

## Data
We are using already available data on Twitter for hate speech recognition consisting of around 25,000 tweets. Each tweet is classified into 3 categories - Hate speech, Offensive, or neither. We use this information to build a classifier for new tweets.

| Class | No of Tweets  |
| ------- | --- |
| Hate Speech | 1431 |
| Offensive | 19190 |
| Neither | 4163 |
